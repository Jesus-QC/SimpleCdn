# SimpleCdn
A very simple CDN made in express in less than 1 hour. With a 404 screen.

## Installation of dependencies
```bash
$ npm i
```

## StartUp
```bash
$ node main.js
```

A folder with the name of `cdn` should have been created.

Any file there will be accessible using `/filename`.

Any folder there will respect the path: `/folder/filename`.

### That is all! You now should be able to see static files of your CDN.
